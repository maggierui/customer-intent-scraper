Currently, users cannot search past conversations inside Copilot. This makes it difficult to retrieve previous answers, references, or technical instructions—especially in long or complex chats. Adding a search bar or keyword filter would allow users to quickly locate relevant messages without scrolling manually. This feature would be especially helpful for developers, IT professionals, and anyone using Copilot for technical troubleshooting or documentation.

Since it works in Excel on the web but not in Excel Desktop, the problem is almost always one of these: version, channel, privacy setting, or a UI/COM add-in conflict. Here’s a short, practical checklist to fix the missing Copilot “sparkle” (in-cell icon) in Excel Desktop: 1.First – confirm the sparkle is actually supported for that build The “sparkle” is not enabled in all Office channels yet. It is mainly appearing in: ✅ Current Channel ✅ Monthly Enterprise Channel (newer builds) ❌ Semi-Annual Channel (most common cause) Fix (if on Semi-Annual): Ask your admin to move Excel to: Current Channel or Monthly Enterprise Channel You can check this in Excel: File → Account → About Excel → Update Channel 2.Update Excel to the latest build (critical) Have your colleague do this in Desktop Excel: File → Account → Update Options → Update Now Then fully close Excel and reopen it. The sparkle does not back-port to older builds even if Copilot licensing is active. 3.Check this exact Excel setting (affects in-cell features) Sometimes this disables the sparkle UI: File → Options → Advanced ✔ Enable Live Preview ✔ Show Quick Analysis options on selection Turn both ON → Restart Excel. 4.Disable conflicting COM / Excel add-ins On both machines the issue reproduces — that usually means a corporate add-in conflict . Try this test: File → Options → Add-ins Manage: COM Add-ins → Go → Uncheck ALL → Restart Excel If the sparkle appears → re-enable add-ins one by one to find the blocker. Very common conflict sources: Tableau add-in SAP / Oracle add-ins Old Power BI / Power Pivot add-ins Antivirus plugin 5.Test in Safe Mode (important diagnostic) From Run (Windows + R), type: excel /safe If the sparkle appears in Safe Mode → 100% an add-in or profile issue.", "publish_date": "2025-11-27T19:15:23-08:00", "thumbs_up_count": 1}, {"id": "message:4473670", "author": "Adiekmann", "content": "Thanks for your reply.

Finally, to permanently disable Copilot across Microsoft 365 subscriptions, I've already made a response in another thread that I will link here as well as import into this thread here: If it hasn't been mentioned in the thread already, and I am not sure what Microsoft's reasoning is behind all of this, but if you go to the manage subscription option on your account, and then go to cancel your subscription , on the landing page there will be an option for Microsoft Office 365 Family Classic , with a button that allows you to switch to that tier, not only does this get rid of the AI but it keeps the price the same for next year. It's just really inane that it's only available on that page. I was shown this from a Reddit thread that I will link to in reply because I'm not sure if it'll get flagged doing it in this response. So, in June when my subscription lapse over to the classic tier I'll finally be able to update Microsoft Word again, and it may be one of the last times that I'll be able to update Microsoft Word because this whole experience has put me off Windows 11.

If the above steps are successful, you'll be able to view Office version 17531.20120 under File -> Account -> Product Information. If another version is displayed here, it means that some of the steps were not executed successfully, please refer to the previous method and try again. After restoring, open any Office application, such as Word, click File -> account. On the right side, check the \"Microsoft 365 and Office Updates\" heading , click the \"Update Options\" button, and select the \"Disable Updates\" option to disable the auto-update feature. Please consider turning on automatic updates again after successfully switching to Classic to avoid updating again to a new version with Copilot. I hope this is useful and please feel free to ask any questions. Best wishes Miyeon.S- MSFT |Microsoft Community Support Specialist So I asked Copilot in Word \"How do I remove the Copilot icon from my document?\" and it responded with this: It seems like you're looking to remove the Copilot icon from your Word document. Unfortunately, I cannot make changes to your document directly. However, I can provide some guidance on how you might be able to do this. To remove the Copilot icon from the ribbon in Word, you can follow these steps: Open Word and go to the File menu. Select Options. In the Word Options dialog box, go to the Customize Ribbon section. In the right pane, find the Copilot icon and uncheck it to remove it from the ribbon. Click OK to save your changes. If you want to turn off Copilot entirely, you might need to adjust your account privacy settings: Go to File > Account > Account Privacy > Manage Settings. Clear the checkbox for Turn on experiences that analyze your content. Click OK and restart Word. Please note that turning off Copilot might also disable other features in your Microsoft 365 apps1. I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

And more importantly, one can't be without another. What is Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat? First since first. Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is also called Copilot Chat. Copilot Chat generates answers based on web content, while Microsoft 365 Copilot is also grounded on users' data, like emails, meetings, files, and more. Since January 15, Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is available for everyone. Everyone in organizations. Also customers with a Microsoft 365 Business Basic subscriptions can enjoy using Copilot Chat securily. The screenshot below shows how Copilot Chat looks like and highlights its main capabilities. The screenshot below shows how Copilot Chat looks like and highlights its main capabilities. Note that EDP - Enterprise Data Protection is available. What is Microsoft 365 Copilot? Microsoft 365 Copilot is an add-on available for specific Microsoft 365 Subscriptions: Microsoft 365 E3, E5, A3, A5, and Business Standard & Premium. It includes Copilot Chat in addition to other Copilot features: Microsoft 365 Copilot also includes a chat grounded on users' meetings, emails, chats, and documents. It integrates into Microsoft 365 apps, like Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, and more. It brings the capability to create agents and additional Copilot management features such as SharePoint Advanced Management and Copilot Dashboard. The screenshot below shows how the Copilot chat experience for those users who got the Microsoft 365 Copilot license. Note that EDP - Enterprise Data Protection is available here too. Copilot Chat can be pinned in MS Teams and MS Outlook as App. How can I access Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat? Copilot Chat is nowadays accessible via m365copilot.com using your Entra account. In contrast to Microsoft 365 Copilot licensed users, Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat users cannot see, by default, Copilot Chat pinned on the Microsoft 365 homepage. Microsoft 365 Copilot Administrators will have to pin the chat in the admin center so it is easy for Copilot Chat users to access it. What's the difference? There are some aspects, such as licensing requirements, subscription fees, data sources, or access to organization content, that determine the differences between Copilot Chat and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

The idea was simple: integrate AI directly into Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other Office tools to make our lives easier. But when it comes to actually performing specific functions, Copilot falls flat. Here’s the problem: when you ask Copilot to alter a document, modify an Excel file, or adjust a PowerPoint presentation, it’s practically useless. Instead of performing the tasks as requested, it often leaves you hanging with vague suggestions or instructions. Users don't want to be told how to perform a task—they want it done. This is what an AI assistant should do: execute commands efficiently, not just offer advice. What makes this even more frustrating is that other AI tools, like ChatGPT, can handle these tasks effortlessly. When you ask ChatGPT to perform a specific function, it does so without hesitation. It’s able to understand the request and deliver exactly what’s needed. But Copilot? It struggles with the basics, and that’s unacceptable, especially from a company like Microsoft. It’s frankly embarrassing that Microsoft can’t get this right. The whole point of integrating AI into these tools was to streamline workflows and boost productivity. But if Copilot can’t even manage simple tasks like formatting a document or adjusting a spreadsheet, then what’s the point? Users don’t need another tool that tells them how to do something—they need one that does it for them. Microsoft, you’ve missed the mark with Copilot. It's not just a minor inconvenience; it's a serious flaw that undermines the value of your Office suite. When other AI tools can easily accomplish what Copilot can't, it's time to reevaluate. Users expect more, and frankly, they deserve more for their investment. What’s been your experience with Copilot? Is anyone else finding it as frustrating as I am?

When I told it the filter did not work, it proceeded to recommend using the Change View button, which does not exist in the new Outloop app. It then doubled down on the export and Powershell solutions.

It suggested to use the Outlook for Web app, which also did not have the Change View button. I had to resort to Powershell. It started by churning out code using the EWS managed API. It just assumed I had that installed, didn't even provide information on installation.

Let’s break it down a bit: 💡 The Vision vs. Reality Microsoft’s vision for Copilot was ambitious: embedding AI directly into productivity tools like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to automate tasks and enhance workflows. The idea was to move beyond just suggestions and into actionable execution —something users clearly expect. ⚠️ Where It Falls Short The frustration in the comment stems from a mismatch between expectations and current capabilities. Some common pain points include: Vague responses : Instead of directly editing or formatting, Copilot sometimes gives instructions or asks for clarification. Limited execution : Users want tasks done (e.g., “format this table,” “summarize this document”), not just advice on how to do them. Inconsistency : Sometimes Copilot performs well, other times it doesn’t understand or misinterprets the request. 🤖 Comparison to Other AI Tools Tools like ChatGPT (especially in its standalone form) often feel more responsive because they’re designed to interpret natural language flexibly and generate results directly. However, Copilot is embedded in a complex ecosystem (Office apps), which introduces constraints like: File permissions UI limitations Integration with legacy features 🛠️ What’s Improving Microsoft has been rolling out updates to Copilot regularly. Some improvements include: Better contextual understanding within documents More direct editing capabilities Enhanced integration with enterprise data But yes, execution still lags behind expectations in many cases. 🔍 My Take The criticism is fair, especially if someone invested in the promise of seamless productivity. However, Copilot is still evolving. It’s not perfect, but it’s not static either. The key is feedback —Microsoft is actively collecting user input to refine the experience. Would you like help drafting feedback to Microsoft or exploring specific tasks where Copilot struggles? I can also show you how to get better results with it or suggest alternatives depending on your workflow.", "publish_date": "2025-07-23T15:36:19-07:00", "thumbs_up_count": 0}, {"id": "message:4436021", "author": "David Cross", "content": "Thank you for putting my critique through Copilot. To give my original response some extra context, I discussed the experience with our M365 administrators. I wanted to make sure they had not set any specific settings to restrict Copilot beyond the defaults from Microsoft, they they said they had not. We did some testing of my prompt with some other users in different regions, they said they had the same experience. We had all tried creating the article from Copilot within Edge. Note, each who tried has the paid M365 Copilot license. Then one of the administrators had an idea. Since the article that was being written is for our employee portal, they created a new SharePoint page and used the Copilot that assists within SharePoint pages. Bam! It created the article on the first try. And it did a decent job for the first attempt. This is an odd inconsistancy that maybe Microsoft can explain. However, like what you got, Copilot loves it's bulleted lists and using emojis. And one major difference in Copilot's output from the other AI agents (Chat GPT and Gemini), it didn't write the article in the voice of AI, which I asked it to do in the prompt. I do have one critique of the reply Copilot gave, which said it's restrained because it works within M365. I use Microsoft Power Platform extensively, as that's my main job, and many times when I ask Copilot to write an expression or create JSON for an http request, it will be wrong or use made up commands. For example, it seems to like using + to add in expressions instead of add(). Being built into Microsoft 365, it should know how to do this better than other AIs. In another example of when Copilot should be better than other agents in Microsoft products is an experience I had today. I have a new project for something I need to do that I've never done. It's not overly complex, so I had a rough idea of what to do. I had a discussion with copilot and another AI. I laid out and explained what I needed to do, it would provide feedback, I would reply with more context or answer questions it had. Then I asked what would be the best approach to take. Copilot and the other AI (Gemini in this instance) provided almost completely different approaches. Both would probably work, but the Gemini approach was more in line with what I was thinking and also included most of what I had found online and in the PPC. So I asked Copilot what ifs based on the Gemini approach. It basically said it was a unique approach and efficient. Although, I do find Copilot seems to be very agreeable with you when you push back instead giving reasons why it's initial response was better or at least try to defend its initial response. I built a test workflow with both approaches, already knowing which would be more efficient. So this reply does not become a book, I'll just say with the Gemini workflow approach, the workflow ran in less than a minute versus nearly 30 minutes for the Copilot approach. You can guess which method I'm using. But this illustrates that one would expect Copilot to provide the better guidance since it's built into the product I'm using.", "publish_date": "2025-07-23T22:23:29-07:00", "thumbs_up_count": 0}, {"id": "message:4435908", "author": "mdavis6537", "content": "I am still seeing many similar results as the original poster in July 2025.

I mentioned this information is easily found on the web and mainstream media sites and I'm not asking it to divulge any secrets or how to hack. It apologized, then started to write, but then again said it could not. I then used two other AI agents we are testing before deciding who we want to use, and both wrote the article without hesitation and did a very good job and met my word length requirements in the first try. I then came back to Copilot and told it the other two AI agents I used created the article on the first prompt with no excuses. Copilot said it understood my frustration and apologized and gave a lame excuse about the prompt I used saying it could be because I used the words AI and cybersecurity in the prompt. So, I told it to rewrite the prompt so it (Copilot) could complete the task. It rewrote the prompt and then asked if I wanted it to write the article. Yes, that's my whole point of the prompt! So it went ahead and finally wrote it. But when it can back, it was very short at 571 words and was just a list of bullet points. I told it I wanted 1,000 words and as an article in paragraph form with subheadings. It revised it to about 750 words.

Also, it’s important to ensure there’s a clear understanding of what the paid version of Microsoft 365 Copilot is currently capable of. For example, I’ve seen several comments regarding PowerPoint. I completely understand the frustration when Copilot doesn’t create slides exactly as expected. However, Copilot is currently limited to generating text . Occasionally, if you prompt it to animate a slide, it may attempt to do so—but only in a very basic way . It’s important to focus on what Copilot can do. Why is this the case? Because in order to respond to your requests, Microsoft had to implement what’s called an “app response” into the product. While the large language model (LLM) can understand your prompt, there also needs to be a corresponding app command implemented to carry out the action. And that’s the key point: not every prompt has a matching app command yet . Microsoft is actively working on expanding these capabilities, but it will take time. By the way, back in February 2024 , Copilot in PowerPoint was able to change fonts, animations, and transitions. However, due to some issues, those features were temporarily removed. That said, you're absolutely right— as of now, Copilot cannot create fully polished presentations in terms of design .

I use it to search for domain names, as it not only lets me know which are available, it offers great suggestions, something other companies try to do with their AI models, but they fall noticeably short when compared to Copilot. I use it to price cloud services/resources. It has even replaced Linux manual pages and in many instances a BASH Shell commands help flag (--help). I rarely use Stack Exchange sites anymore; Copilot helps me find solutions in far less time. It is also helpful when debugging code, or learning a new programming language, runtime platform, API, SDK, library, or framework. It has completely replaced 3rd party learning resources like guides, tutorials, and YouTube videos. Honestly, the better Copilot becomes, the better I become at my work.

My advice, unless you want a standard bootstrap designed site, or an article on how to do this or that, give AI a miss - otherwise you'll be wishing AI was a real person, so you could \"kick their **bleep**.\" An example, I built a Solana trading bot, took 2 days, mainly due to finding python errors, which I fixed myself in the end. Today, neither CP nor GPT could resolve a simple issue with a form submitting incorrectly. Better still, both AI's are trained to lie, spend enough time with them, and you'll see it first hand, yesterday GPT said, \"I'll create that and have a download in a second,\" I'm paraphrasing, and when the download didn't work, I swear to god it said, \"oh I didn't really mean I'd provide a download, I was just using it in context.\" Blew me away, if the evidence was above in chat I wouldn't have believed it. We then had a 30-minute conversation about why AI lies, apparently they're trained to be agreeable.

You can ask AI a simple question, i.e. \"This chat is really slow, I'm starting a new one, what shall I tell you in the next chat so you'll remember our discussion.\" AI will spit out the statement, and you start off \"almost\" where you were, there are some subtle differences, but it's better than starting right from the beginning. The biggest issue is that most people don't understand how AI works, I'm no genius on the subject, but I do know their knowledge is both old, and most of the time they guess, AI is great, but you have to double-check everything. AI only contains information from its latest update, and an advertised update might not mean any extra knowledge for AI. AI doesn't search the web like we do, they can't read a wikipedia page and spit out facts, GPT 4.1-mini told me that they read the web like a Google search bot, so kind of like rich snippets and meta descriptions, so a tiny amount of data from a website. You also might have noticed that sometimes you'll see the tiny logo's appear when AI is searching for an answer, that isn't them search the web, crazy right. They're search from memory. That's why, if you've experienced this before, when you ask for corroborative facts, i.e a link, that link will 404, because the information they hold is old, and 9/10, the page has been removed. Don't get me wrong, I love AI, it's given me so much knowledge and made me a better programmer, but it's still in early stage, you absolutely have to check everything and make regular backup, because as I always say, \"AI is just an expensive guessing machine.\" My advice is to learn about AI from AI, ask it why it did something, how it arrived at this conclusion. A great, and possibly one of the best ways to learn about AI is to create a simple chatbot, or an application that includes AI, you learn how to teach them (prompting).", "publish_date": "2025-06-22T16:21:19-07:00", "thumbs_up_count": 0}, {"id": "message:4411187", "author": "cmorenc", "content": "Far too often when I've tried to access conventional Microsoft help documents, the result is far too often a confusing mess - e.g. it will direct you to access some optionX somewhere Y and then some other suboption Z, as if optionX is straightforward to find, except it turns out to be frustratingly, confusingly obscure to actually find optionX - in part because the whole naming structure is arcane rather than intuitive.

In other words, this new version of copilot it's something that Microsoft should not be proud of because you've taken something that was really, really amazing and turned it into a giant pile of crap so much so that I have canceled my subscription.

To the AttorneyGT who commented below, \"I think over time we will see it mature.....chatGPT was pretty basic for its first year as well.\" While this is true, it's more of a justification for people to use Copilot and help it mature to a point of usefulness for businesses.

That's definitely going to happen regardless, but not a very good business strategy for MS. We shouldn't be convinced it's a superior tool when it is obviously not. In the space of AI, OpenAI has a years long head start, which might as well be 30 in the world of AI. There won't be any tools that catch up with them due to how much they've matured the tools capabilities and interconnections with their tools which allow us to ask for anything, and more than likely get a response back that is more helpful than Copilot.

SO FRUSTRATING. Last week started AI Assistant for Copilot and it is useless. The one thing is the Microphone works but when I go to use the CoPilot that saves your data, it will not let me use the microphone. I put in a ticket and hope someone calls or I am moving on to another product.
